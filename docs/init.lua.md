# init.lua

The init.lua file is the only required Lua script to run the slipstream application.
The file will be created if it does not exist.

Located in %AppData%/Slipstream/init.lua

IMPORTANT: If init.lua is missing a default one will be generated on startup. As 
long as the file exists, Slipstream will not modify it.

## Usage
init.lua can be used to customise the loading of plugins and change the default behaviour of
a plugin. Make sure to look at individual plugins for more information on registration options.
