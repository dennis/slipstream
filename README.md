## What's Slipstream?

Slipstream is an event-based application, that was built to connect or act on
events from [IRacnig](http://www.iracing.com).

A number of Slipstream plugins generates event or acts on events. As user of
Slipstream you can provide Lua scripts that interacts with these events as
well. This allows you to write Lua scripts that records laptimes to a file,
output messages to twitch, play samples or use text-to-speech to notify you.

## Installation

Download the latest version of
[Slipstream](https://github.com/dennis/slipstream/releases/download/v0.3.0/slipstream-v0.3.0.msi)
and run the installer.

## Usage

 - Upon launch, go to menu: Help -> Open Scripts Directory
 - Download and save [LuaScripts/debug.lua](LuaScripts/debug.lua) into this
   directory. This will output the received events as JSON
